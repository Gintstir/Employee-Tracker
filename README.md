## **Installation**
Once the repistory has been cloned, use the command `npm install` or `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies: **[mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)**, **[console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)**, **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**, **[figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet)**, and **[Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)**.  

## **Usage**

The app comes preloaded with tables in the schema.sql file and entries in the seeds.sql file. Feel free to edit this data to suit your needs.  When the the required data has been added, activate mySQL using the command `mysql -u root -p` in the terminal.  You will be prompted to enter you mySQL password.  To popute the table use the commands `source schema.sql` and `source seeds.sql`.  The app is now ready to be used. In a seperate terminal, not the mySQL CLI open the app using `npm start` or `Node server.js`.  You can now use Employee-Tracker!
